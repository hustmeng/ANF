# ANF (adaptive normalizing flow)


ANF (Action-based Neural Flow) is a neural simulation framework designed to efficiently generate independent lattice field theory (LFT) configurations for complex target distributions. By learning invertible transformations from simple Gaussian inputs to target distributions defined by physical actions, ANF dramatically accelerates LFT sampling while reducing computational cost and autocorrelation times.
